      Companies often perceive environmental regulations as bureaucratic hurdles and cost drivers. Notwithstanding, there are also examples of companies proactively looking for innovative and creative solutions to anchor the issue of environmental and climate protection in their core business. These companies use the topic of responsible management as an innovation driver and differentiator. Their aim is not only to protect the environment and the climate, but also to be economically successful as a company.

      A Brazilian family business from the tourism industry is trying to implement this consistently and has thus produced numerous innovations in recent years. For example, the company uses the heat of the coal fire in the traditional Churrasqueira to generate hot water for the hotel and restaurant business. A suitable name for the method was also invented: “Banho gaucho”. With innovations such as this, the company is differentiating itself in the Brazilian tourism market and has thus been able to grow successfully, even in a difficult economic environment. The innovation also helps the company save several thousand US dollars in energy costs every month.
