      Although slavery is forbidden in Brazil and is prosecuted, there are always cases of exploitative employment relationships and modern slavery. Such human rights violations occur, for example, in the fields of sugar cane or fruit plantations as well as in soy cultivation. Work on the plantations is often the only one that exists in rural regions. Occupational safety precautions are often inadequate and the workers are housed under inhumane conditions.

      In addition, the Brazilian agricultural sector is characterized by numerous land conflicts. Unresolved ownership issues and the advance of the agricultural border have led to the expulsion of small farmers and the indigenous population. In Brazil, the indigenous population is largely marginalized. The lack of security of their land rights repeatedly leads to violent clashes.

      However, there are also examples of companies that proactively cooperate with the indigenous population and, for example, provide them with market access. This includes a family business in the agritourism sector. The indigenous families from a nearby reserve can sell their handicrafts on the site of the eco-farm and do not have to pay any commission for this. Once a year the farm also hosts a Week of Brazilian Indigenous Peoples, during which numerous cultural events take place. This cooperation provides the indigenous community with an adequate livelihood based on their own cultural identity.
