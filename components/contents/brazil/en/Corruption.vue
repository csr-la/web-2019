      Due to the corruption scandal surrounding the parastatal oil company Petrobr√°s and other former flagship companies, which has been under review since 2014, the fight against corruption is very much present in the Brazilian public and media today. This has led to a broad consensus on the need to fight corruption as it diverts resources from education, healthcare and other important government services. The country only has a realistic chance of achieving the United Nations' sustainable development goals if it succeeds in curbing corruption on a sustainable basis.

      In addition, many entrepreneurs and managers seem to have recognized that corrupt behavior can have serious and devastating consequences for businesses. In addition to raising awareness, companies have taken a number of concrete steps to improve their corporate governance principles. A large number of training courses, conferences, seminars and publications are offered to help companies do this.

      To assist Brazilian companies in this process, a large multinational company once a month invites six to eight companies to show guests how a compliance system works in practice and how it can be adapted and implemented. Around 500 companies have already taken part in this special type of business management. In addition, the company has developed special materials for schools and universities to raise awareness of corruption prevention among pupils and students.
