      The systematic recycling of used products and materials is still relatively uncommon in Mexico. In recent years, various companies have begun to introduce recycling programs to recycle paper, packaging materials or water bottles. To motivate employees to participate in its recycling program and at the same time improve the working environment, a multinational company is holding a series of competitions during the year. In one of these competitions, for example, the team that collects the most plastic bottles wins a meal. The teams must consist of four to five employees from different areas of the company. As a result, employees get involved in recycling while communicating and collaborating across departments. Through activities such as these, employees collect bagged packaging material, which the company then forwards to a charitable organization. This organizations can, for example, produce new handmade bags or other handicrafts from the used material.
