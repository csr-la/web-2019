      In Mexico, so-called pseudo trade unions or protective trade unions are a common phenomenon. These conclude contracts with companies called Contratos de Protecci√≥n (protection contracts for industrial peace). The protection contracts are often favor agreements that hardly exceed the minimum requirements with regard to wages and social benefits and serve to keep independent, democratically constituted trade unions out of the company. Protective trade unions are often backed by individuals who, as private individuals, are the owners of collective agreements and can inherit them. As a rule, protection agreements are concluded without the knowledge and consent of the employees. Employees of the company are represented by the protection union, even if they are not union members. Those who do not wish to be represented by the union automatically lose their jobs. Companies often finance protection unions directly by transferring part of the payroll to the union.

      Many international companies arrange a protection agreement with a pseudo-union during the investment phase, even before hiring their first employees. On the other hand, there are also international companies that allow independent, democratically constituted trade unions. In theory, at least, they should do more to promote the interests of employees. In practice, however, this is not always the case, partly due to the lack of competence and inadequate organization of trade unions.
