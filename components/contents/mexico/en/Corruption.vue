      Corruption is widespread in Mexico. International companies and organizations have to give money to the postman to deliver the mail reliably and to the garbage men to take the waste with them. Street vendors have to bribe policemen on a daily basis so that they can sell their goods. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the formal sector also face corruption. They need a large number of licenses and permits, the acquisition of which is considered susceptible to corruption. However, SMEs also see themselves at a disadvantage due to the frequent lack of fair competition. There is, for example, the phenomenon of fictitious firms that are only set up to cobble together orders. These companies are only a few days old and receive an order worth several million US dollars, even though they do not have the necessary qualified personnel etc.

      Until a few years ago, companies were hardly interested in fighting corruption. They were of the opinion that corruption was a problem for the government to solve. This has changed. Today, various business associations are actively involved in the fight against corruption and private companies finance anti-corruption activities. As a rule, however, companies do not want to publicly expose themselves, as they shy away from confrontation with the government, on which they depend, for example, when awarding public contracts.

      In their fight against corruption, parts of the constitutional business community have joined forces with other civil society actors. With the help of the first referendum in Mexico's history, this collective action has led to a tightening of anti-corruption legislation at the federal level.
