      In Peru's most poor and inaccessible mining regions, the conflicting interests of the local indigenous population and the mine operators clash. In the countless small gold mines, hazardous working conditions and illegal working and mining methods are the order of the day. These include the improper use of mercury and cyanide to bind the gold, but also various forms of forced labor. In industrial mining, which is operated by large, mostly multinational companies, working conditions and ecological standards are generally better, but there is still considerable potential for conflict in large mining operations. Conflicts over land and water, illegal or involuntary resettlement, environmental pollution or the excessive use of local infrastructure are just some of the reasons that repeatedly lead to sometimes violent conflicts.

      There are also active police officers who work as second jobs for private security services in mining companies to improve their low state salaries. This dual function increases the potential for conflict with the local population, who have the impression that the police only represent the interests of the mining companies and are not there to protect the population. When companies engage private security services, for which active police officers work, they must ensure that there is a clear separation between the different functions of the people hired.

      When trading in small-scale mining raw materials, international companies have a responsibility to ensure that human rights and environmental standards are respected along the value chain.
