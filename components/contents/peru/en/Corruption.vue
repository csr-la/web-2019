      Everyday corruption is also an issue in Peru. It manifests itself in the bribery of police officers on the street corner or at roadblocks. In traffic accidents, for example, a bribe is given to the police officer responsible to “forget the matter” - in Peru, this is called “arreglar”. But also in the construction sector, criminal up to mafia-like structures are present. Companies sometimes make informal payments to the construction workers to ensure that the building materials, such as wood, paint and bricks, are still available the next morning and have not been resold by the workers. Many companies are in this corrupt cycle and are paying because they don't want to risk being without building materials.

      In the meantime, however, more and more companies are defending themselves against widespread corruption. Especially among the young generation of entrepreneurs, the view is prevalent that corruption is not a trivial offence and that, in the long term, there are no winners but only losers. For example, they no longer take part in tenders where they know that they cannot get ahead without informal payments. They want to get their contracts honestly.

      A merger of companies that are allying themselves against the vicious circle of corrupt machinations could help to tackle corruption in Peru with joined forces and fight it in the long term.
