      Peru is one of the most important mining regions in the world. In many cases, mining is associated with considerable environmental pollution and destruction. The improper use of mercury and other toxic substances is still widespread, especially in informal and illegal small-scale mining. The consequences of this are polluted rivers and groundwater, contaminated air and soil, which burden the livelihoods of local smallholders and indigenous peoples or even destroy them forever.

      There are few controls by the state. On the one hand, there are hardly any access roads to the mines, as they are mostly located in remote rural areas, and on the other hand, the state and individual public officials benefit financially from mining. Therefore, they have no particular interest in carrying out strict controls.

      Companies therefore have a responsibility to take appropriate measures to counter environmental degradation. The Swiss Better Gold Initiative is a development initiative in the field of small-scale mining that aims to make the mining and trading of gold more socially and ecologically sustainable. In addition to improving social conditions in mines and cooperatives and creating transparency in the value chain, the initiative aims to reduce the use of environmentally harmful technologies. For example, there are various ways to minimize the use of mercury, for example, by using vibrating machines to remove the gold from the stone.
