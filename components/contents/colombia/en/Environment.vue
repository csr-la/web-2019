      The Colombian agricultural sector is a sector that faces many challenges in terms of environmental protection. Pesticides classified by the World Health Organization as toxic and carcinogenic are used in industrial flower production. Due to a lack of safety precautions, the chemicals cause diseases and contamination of the groundwater around the flower plantations.

      In the agro-industry, however, there are also examples of companies that are actively committed to environmental and climate protection. For example, a Colombian family business in the beverage and sugar industry invested millions in new technologies to reduce its environmental impact. For instance, modern chimney systems were installed to filter the majority of pollutants from the exhaust air; as well as irrigation systems were purchased to reduce the waste of water to a minimum. In addition, the company sells sugar cane press residues to companies that make paper from them. Other processing residues are used to produce ethanol, which is used for energy production. This way, the company attempts to recycle or reuse as many materials as possible.
