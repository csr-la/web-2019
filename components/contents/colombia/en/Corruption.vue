      The Colombian economy is characterized by a high degree of informality. The majority of employees work in the informal sector. A distinction is made between informal and illegal enterprises. Informal companies basically operate in accordance with the rules but are not registered with the Chamber of Commerce. In principle, however, they could be registered. On the contrary,  illegal companies are those that engage in activities that cannot be authorized  because they operate, for example, in areas that are under nature conservation. On the one hand, the companies perceive formalization as an unnecessarily large bureaucratic effort; on the other hand, there is a widespread belief that those who pay taxes will be robbed. . In addition, the companies orient themselves to their surroundings. If they also work informally and are not punished, then why change something?

      For multinational companies and local companies in the formal sector, the high level of informality poses considerable challenges. This is particularly the case when companies are implementing projects in rural areas, where the level of informality is particularly high. Nevertheless, even in this case there are examples of companies that are able to ensure that only formal companies are active in their supply chain.

      On the one hand, companies achieve this by bringing formal suppliers from large cities to rural areas, even if this often proves to be very inefficient due to the large geographical distances. On the other hand, the companies also develop suppliers from rural areas and lead them to the formality. Some companies include these development tasks in their project calculations. The involvement of local companies in the project work has the positive additional effect that it significantly increases the acceptance of the project among the local population.
