      The peace agreement between the Colombian state and the guerilla organization FARC offers the chance that the violence in Colombia will decrease. However, the withdrawal of the FARC from its former territories has created a power vacuum that allows other armed groups to spread. The state was not present in the territories of the FARC and is still not fulfilling the role it would have to assume. This leaves the population in a defenseless and lawless space, where they continue to suffer violence from paramilitary organizations, illegal groups and criminal gangs.

      The successful implementation of the peace process also requires the economic development of rural areas, often difficult to access, which have been dominated by the guerrilla group for decades. The private sector has an important role to play here, for example, by creating jobs or reintegrating former FARC fighters into civilian (working) life. To this end, they must receive vocational training, among other things. Even if companies cannot be given full responsibility for this, there are some  examples of companies that have created a working environment with decent working conditions.

      After more than 50 years of civil war, however, the private sector is also called upon to play an active role in coming to terms with the armed conflict and thus contribute to reconciliation. To this end, companies must reappraise their role in the armed conflict, for example, by participating in a national truth commission or by having historians investigate whether and how the company has cooperated with guerrilla groups or paramilitary organizations.
