      With regard to human rights/working conditions, it should be noted that in Argentina, working conditions in Buenos Aires and the surrounding area are generally classified as humane, not least because of the comparatively strong position of the trade unions. Nevertheless, illegal workshops are repeatedly discovered here, where safety regulations and hygienic standards are disregarded and slave-like working conditions prevail. In addition, cases of child labor can still be observed in the rural regions of Argentina, e.g. in Yerba Mate production and other areas of agriculture. Child labor is prohibited in Argentina. The minimum working age is 16 years. Numerous families from the poor rural population, whose children work, do not see child labor as anything reprehensible, on the contrary, in part it is even regarded as part of the culture. The parents were child laborers themselves and now their children grow up in the same environment and have the same experiences. This traditional anchoring leads to a lack of awareness of injustice among families and the rural population.

      There are numerous campaigns to raise awareness of the injustice of child labor and to help families move children away from hard physical labor and enable them to attend school. Furthermore, companies within their sphere of influence ensure that suppliers pay their employees adequate wages. This reduces the need for children to earn money. Standards and controls have been developed and enforced.
