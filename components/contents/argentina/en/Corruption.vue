      In Argentina, there is a general perception that corruption is widespread in both the public and private sector and that corruption is widely accepted. Lack of state control and impunity encourage corruption. In addition, inflation encourages corrupt behavior, as companies are unable to draw up proper budgets and financial figures are distorted. The same applies to erratic economic, monetary and exchange rate policies, as well as the crises that repeatedly shake the Argentine economy, as they encourage short-term thinking in companies. For companies that behave in accordance with the rules, this is often associated with considerable economic uncertainty and financial disadvantages.

      In recent years, foreign companies have also been and still are involved in this network of advantage acceptances, bribes and payoffs, as they were not prepared to give up business.

      Companies use the Collective Action approach, among other things, for this purpose, as the following example shows: Port inspectors charged an informal fee for tourist ships. If the shipping companies did not pay these fees, their ships were not cleared. One company did not want to get involved and joined forces with other companies to form a Collective Action. As a result, the inspectors did not allow the ships of several companies to land. This attracted the attention of the public and the media. In response to public pressure, the inspectors decided to handle the vessels without paying the informal fee. Since then, it has no longer been necessary to pay them.
