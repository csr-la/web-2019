      Environmental protection is a central topic that companies in Argentina are confronted with when it comes to assuming corporate responsibility. There are numerous examples of companies that discharge their wastewater untreated into rivers or do not dispose of industrial waste adequately. Polluted groundwater, especially in the vicinity of major urban and industrial centers, and the decline in fish stocks and forest resources result as a consequence of this behavior.

      Another issue concerns the use of water resources, which are very unevenly distributed throughout the country. While the west of Argentina has large freshwater sources, there are places with very low water availability towards the Andes Cordillera. Here, the local population competes with companies for access to water. In addition, the use of resources such as water and energy in Argentina is very inexpensive, as many prices are subsidized by the state. Many companies therefore have no financial incentive to invest in resource-conserving technologies.

      Since the state infrastructure and controls in the area of environmental protection are only weakly developed, it is the responsibility of the companies to promote a conscious consumption of water and energy as well as responsible waste disposal. In many cases, multinational companies play a pioneering role in environmental protection, for example, in waste avoidance or waste separation. The resulting plastic, metal and paper waste is resold to other companies and recycled. Organic waste is composted and special incinerators are installed for industrial waste. Nevertheless, there are also good examples of environmental protection among local companies. For example, a family business has built its own sewage treatment plant for the port it operates, as the local authority responsible does not provide adequate infrastructure.
